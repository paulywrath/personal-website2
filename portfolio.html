              <p>I saved a beached whale once. As I watched him struggling I realized
                something was obstructing his breathing. I could barely see from 
                all of the waves crashing down on top of me but I knew something was
                there, so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction!</p>

              <p>Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim? I did that. It didn't 
                take very long either.</p>

              <p>I import chips: potato chips, some corn. Also, matches. The long 
                matches. <br>

                I export diapers, but I want to give up the exporting and focus 
                on the importing.</p>
