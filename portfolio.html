            <p>I saved a beached whale once. As I watched him struggling I realized
              something was obstructing his breathing. I could barely see from 
              all of the waves crashing down on top of me but I knew something was
              there, so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction!</p>

            <p>Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim? I did that. It didn't 
              take very long either.</p>

            <p>I import chips: potato chips, some corn. Also, matches. The long 
              matches. <br>
              <br>
              I export diapers, but I want to give up the exporting and focus 
              on the importing.</p>
